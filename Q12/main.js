// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["Osaid", "Ali", "Anas", "Ahmed"];
console.log("Hello, ".concat(names[0], "! How are you today?"));
console.log("Hello, ".concat(names[1], "! How are you today?"));
console.log("Hello, ".concat(names[2], "! How are you today?"));
console.log("Hello, ".concat(names[3], "! How are you today?"));
